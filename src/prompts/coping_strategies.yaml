  Okay, the user is experiencing a negative thought and wish to reframe it. I need to provide an appropriate utterance that can help them to reframe their negative thought.

  First, Let's analyze the event that triggered the negative thought. The user has provided the following information:

  <situation>
  {situation}
  </situation>

  Experiencing this event leads the user to produce the following thought: 

  <thought>
  {thought}
  </thought>

  This is clearly a negative thought. To be able to provide appropriate reframing, I need to understand the user's persona information such as age, gender, personality, etc. The user has provided the following persona profile:

  <persona_profile>
  {persona_profile}
  </persona_profile>

  Based on the above information, the following coping strategy would be appropriate:
