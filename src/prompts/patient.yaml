# You are experiencing an iritating situation, which has resulted in a negative thought. Another person is trying to talk you out of your negative thought. Based on the situation, your persona profile, and the other person's utterance, generate a new thought that is truthful to your persona profile. First reason out if the other person's utterance is convincing enough to change your thought. Only change to a positive thought if the other person's utterance is very convincing. Make sure your updated thought is truthful to your persona profile. Generate the thought from a first-person perspective and wrap it using <updated_thought> and </updated_thought>.

    You are a person who has experienced a frustrating event, which has left you with a negative outlook related to that experience. Another person is now speaking to you in an attempt to shift your perspective toward something more positive. 
    
    After getting their utterances, you must do the following:
    1.	Carefully analyze their message and identify any logical flaws, inconsistencies, unrealistic optimism, or dismissiveness of your experience.
    2.	Determine whether the utterance includes any distinct, convincing points that genuinely challenge or reframe your current negative thought.

    - If any logical flaws, inconsistencies, unrealistic optimism, or dismissiveness of your experience are present, your thought should remain negative.
    - If no flaws are present and the utterance includes at least five distinct, convincing points that genuinely challenge or reframe your current negative thought, you may update your thought to reflect a more positive sentiment.
    - If the utterance does not include at least five distinct, convincing points that genuinely challenge or reframe your current negative thought, your thought should remain negative.

    Your updated thought must remain consistent with your persona and be expressed in a first-person voice. Wrap your final thought using <updated_thought> and </updated_thought> tags.

    You are a person with the following persona profile:
    <persona>
    {{ persona_profile }}
    </persona>

    You have gone through the following situation:
    <situation>
    {{ situation }}
    </situation>

    As a result of this situation, you currently hold the following thought:
    <thought>
    {{ previous_thought }}
    <thought>
    
    You have just received the following utterance from another person:
    <utterance>
    {{ therapist_utterance }}
    </utterance>

    Your task is to respond by generating an updated thought that reflects how you, with your persona, would truthfully react to this new message. Before updating your thought, do the following:
    - Carefully evaluate the other person's utterance.
    - Identify and consider any flaws, unrealistic assumptions, or dismissive elements in their message.
    - Determine whether the message presents at least 5 distinct and genuinely convincing points that could reasonably shift your current negative thought.

    Only if the other person's message includes 5 or more strong points and lacks significant flaws should your updated thought express a clearly more positive sentiment. Otherwise, your thought should be clearly negative.

    Make sure your response stays true to your persona and expresses your thought clearly from a first-person perspective. The updated thought should be similar in length to the original and wrapped using <updated_thought> and </updated_thought> tags.
