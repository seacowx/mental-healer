I was upstairs getting dressed and he was downstairs on the computer, and I could hear a popping sound. I thought that it was just the bathroom tap leaking but I still told my dad. He immediately thought it was an electrical issue so he turned off the house electricity from the mains. He stepped out of the house and all we could see was the roof on fire. I stupidly ran back in the house to get my phone and inhalers and he shouted me down, moved the  cars out of the driveway. The whole street was watching whilst the house was on fire, we'd called the fire engines and the police. My mum was called from work and when she turned onto the street she collapsed in shock, my dad was a mess and crying and running about. I was calm but inside I was scared. We were given a hotel from ther insurance company and it wasn't until the next day when we went to see the damage and all of the roof was gone, our bedrooms completely burnt down. I felt fear at that point.",

Every day i went to sit by my grandmother to keep her company and spend as much time with as possible. We were told that she wouldn't last much longer and yet my father and relatives decided drinking would be a better way to pass the time rather than stay with her as long as they could. I spent the night alone with the nurse and my grandmother while they all got drunk to drown their sorrows. I was so disgusted by their behaviour as well as angry. The disgust hasn't really left.",

It was my first ever time clubbing on my own, and two young men around my age (or I presume so, as it was a Fresher's week event so they were likely fellow students) flirted with me and made inappropriate comments about me, including some homophobic comments when I told them I was a lesbian and therefore wasn't interested. Before I had even entered the club, one of the boys grabbed my hips from behind and touched me inappropriately while rubbing himself against me. I immediately turned around in a rage and told him I didn't want him touching me, and when a security guard came over to see what the fuss was I confidently reported the incident and got the boys thrown out. I'd never stood up to someone harassing me before, and I felt incredibly empowered.",
