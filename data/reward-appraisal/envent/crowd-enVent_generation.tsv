This was not the first time, in fact it had gone on for about two years and this time was the final straw. It was time for me to stick up for my child and put a stop to it once and for all. My child was a target i guess, we had concerns over autism/adhd and this parent really took advantage of that. On this occasion, it was a Friday afternoon and the teacher asked to speak with me, so in i went. I knew it was serious as the Deputy head was also there. They explained that my child (year 3) had told a reception kid that his grandad was going to bring a gun to school (now bear in mind that this parent also knows that we (my husband) has a shotgun licence) and that her child was scared. This was also not the first time that she had made reference to my child and guns at school. I sat, i listened and i thought, its not really my childs style. I asked when this was said and i was told it was said over the xbox. I asked if this was by message or speaking on the mic and the teacher confirmed it was over the mic. This is where i knew that this was not right as my child headset was broken and he was unable to talk to people unless he sent a message! The anger rose up inside me. This parent lives right next to the school and when i left i was so angry that i went to confront and started banging on the door (not like me at all). She wasn't in and in hindsight it was probably a good thing she wasn't in! I was so angry that afternoon that i really dont know what i would have done if she answered as anger had just consumed me. I went home and spoke with my child and he completely denied the allegations and i believed him. I was seething all weekend and by the Monday she contacted me and asked if we could sort things out. Long story short, she admitted that it was a case of he said, she said, Ben said and that she had not hear the words come out of his mouth. This was 6 years ago and still to this day i can not forgive all that she put my child through.	another parent at school wrongly accused my child of saying/doing something that he didn't do.

I checked my credit score and credit information and it was much lower than I anticipated. It turned out it was because I was the victim of identity theft and someone had opened credit cards in my name but without my knowledge or permission. I then had contacted the collection agency who were extremely rude and threatening and after months of back and forth, I eventually was able to prove the debt wasn't mine. However, during this time I uncovered an email address attached to the credit card accounts that very closely matched one similar to that my stepdad uses so I was furious and phoned him up to confront him about it. He denied it but to this day, neither my partner or I trust him and I avoid contact with him as much as possible.

Yet other personalities wanted to have representation on the managing committee based on their friendships, not on the process of the co op. The irony was that I wanted to pass on the role anyway, but doing so in such an abrupt way was irresponsible as well as the obvious deception and disregard for all my hard work. The roles in the co op are all voluntary which makes it even worse that an atmosphere of competition was set up when we could have collaborated and had a nice smooth handover transition period.

The irony was that I wanted to pass on the role anyway, but doing so in such an abrupt way was irresponsible as well as the obvious deception and disregard for all my hard work. The roles in the co op are all voluntary which makes it even worse that an atmosphere of competition was set up when we could have collaborated and had a nice smooth handover transition period.	weeks	weeks	4	5	5	1	2	1	5	3	1	1	5	3	3	4	4	5	1	3	5	4	4	1	5	Yes, first time, I will answer the following questions.	43	Female	Graduate degree (MA/MSc/MPhil/other)	Jewish white British	6.0	5.0	6.0	3.0	6.0	3.0	6.0	7.0	6.0	1.0	The event really happened in my life.

I was seeing a man for 4 years and we were very much in love. And then things changed. He went from being someone who I used to have fun with, laugh with, chat to all the time to someone who was completely focused on work, focused on making money, focused on the future and I no longer enjoyed being with him. However, because I had been with him for so long I stayed with him for another couple of months even though I no longer was happy in the relationship. During that time it seemed like every time we saw each other, I got nothing out of the encounter. All he would talk about was work (he was a lawyer) and football. Neither law or football hold any interest for me. It just seemed like everything that had initially brought us together had been removed and I was so bored and fed up with him. Unfortunately he didn't feel the same way and when I finished things he was absolutely devastated but for me, it was like starting a new life.	I felt ... in a relationship a number of years ago.

I went to a large wooded area and after walking a while I heard a noise and then I saw dogs coming fast towards me. They started growling and barking . I started to run but I knew they would catch me. Luckily a tree nearby had limbs low enough for me to climb. I went up in the tree and four dogs came to the bottom of the tree and looked up at me and kept barking and growling. I was very scared. They kept me up in that tree for a couple hours then left. I waited awhile before I got down. Thank goodness they were gone. I got out of there as fast as possible.	When I was younger I used to go on hikes by myself a lot.

They ended up getting arrested after trying to sell my phone on eBay but didn't think to reset it, so with the help of the police, I was able to get my phone and wallet back.	minutes	weeks	5	5	5	1	1	1	5	5	3	1	5	3	1	5	1	5	1	2	5	5	5	5	5	No, I participated before and answered the next set of questions.	19	Male	High school	North American	3.0	5.0	3.0	4.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	4.0	4.0	2.0	The event really happened in my life.

Me and my dad were home and we had just returned from an outing. I was upstairs getting dressed and he was downstairs on the computer, and I could hear a popping sound. I thought that it was just the bathroom tap leaking but I still told my dad. He immediately thought it was an electrical issue so he turned off the house electricity from the mains. He stepped out of the house and all we could see was the roof on fire. I stupidly ran back in the house to get my phone and inhalers and he shouted me down, moved the  cars out of the driveway. The whole street was watching whilst the house was on fire, we'd called the fire engines and the police. My mum was called from work and when she turned onto the street she collapsed in shock, my dad was a mess and crying and running about. I was calm but inside I was scared. We were given a hotel from ther insurance company and it wasn't until the next day when we went to see the damage and all of the roof was gone, our bedrooms completely burnt down.

I was visiting my younger sister who was working overseas and we had a brilliant time together. She took lots of photos of us, had them developed (it was the 1990s!) and sent them to my family. In one picture in particular, all I could see were these awful braces. I couldn't see anything else - the fabulous place we were in, the gorgeous outfits we were wearing, how lovely our hair was as we'd treated ourselves to getting blowdries, and I wrote her the most horrible letter saying that the only reason she'd sent that photo was to prove how gorgeous she was compared to me, she knew how ugly I was and that I was sorry I'd ever visited her in the first place. To this day I still feel so awful for writing that letter. She could only see the fun time we were having - I was the one with the complex about my teeth.

It was my first ever time clubbing on my own, and two young men around my age (or I presume so, as it was a Fresher's week event so they were likely fellow students) flirted with me and made inappropriate comments about me, including some homophobic comments when I told them I was a lesbian and therefore wasn't interested. Before I had even entered the club, one of the boys grabbed my hips from behind and touched me inappropriately while rubbing himself against me. I immediately turned around in a rage and told him I didn't want him touching me, and when a security guard came over to see what the fuss was I confidently reported the incident and got the boys thrown out.

My teacher told me that she assured me that I would not need a tutor and she would provide all the extra help I needed.
