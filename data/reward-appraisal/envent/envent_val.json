When I asked him about it, he said he left it on the floor for me to pick up later. I would be regretful to see how he treats janitors and service staff.",

We were fishing in a pond full of small fish (there's a seperate one where you had to pay to fish the larger fish). An hour into our day and my fishing rod nearly snaps with the weight of the fish on the line!! Seeing my dads face light up with surprise and seeing how impressed he was at me brought me great joy!

It's mostly because my ex was extremely wealthy and although my current bf and I are well off for our age, it's tough when I consider that I could be flown around in a private jet instead. I feel extremely guilty thinking about this and typing it out because I don't want to sound greedy. I just grew up in the lowest income bracket and I can't help but be enticed by money as it was such a barrier growing up. I'm trying really hard to develop a healthier relationship with it as I grow older.",
