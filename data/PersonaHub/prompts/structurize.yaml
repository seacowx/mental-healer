  Given the a persona profile, which is a paragraph of descriptive text, convert it into a structured JSON format. The JSON should contain the following fields:

  - age: The age of the persona 
  - occupation: The occupation of the persona
  - gender: The gender of the persona, choose from ["male", "female", "unknown"]
  - education: The education level of the persona, choose from ["high school", "bachelor's", "master's", "PhD", "unknown"]

  The persona profile may not contain all of the fields. First try to infer the missing fields from the text. If you cannot infer the missing fields, set them to "unknown".   
  
  The JSON should be formatted as follows:

  {
    "age": <age>,
    "occupation": <occupation>,
    "gender": <gender>,
    "education": <education>
  }

  Persona profile:
  {{persona_profile}}
